# Dot Slash News

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Description

Dot Slash News is a full-stack news portal web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It features three types of login systems based on user roles, providing different pages and routes for visitors and logged-in users. Users can add, edit, and delete news articles. The application leverages Google Firebase for authentication and JWT tokens for security.
